      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Implemented a C program to simulate a theaterâ€™s inventory system using a hash table with separate chaining. 
        The program supports buying items, selling products, and updating prices while tracking cash flow and operation complexity. 
        This system was designed to handle up to 300,000 commands efficiently with amortized O(1) operations.
